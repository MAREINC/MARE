Social Worker Feedback:


PRAISE:

?Event went well and there seemed to be more families there.?

?Easy to get in and out of that part of the city.?

?Received several good potential families and was very busy talking to families about many different children.?

?I would like to say that some aspects of the party were very good and entertaining.?

?I enjoyed the event and I?m happy that MARE had returned to the Girls and Boys Club in Dorchester for a recruitment event.?

?Keep up the good work and I will continue to assist you.?

?Liked the cookies and pizza.?

?It was nice that one of the prospective families organized a group of the older boys to give their shoot around some structure and even an impromptu game. 

?I did talk with a lot of families that seemed very interested.?

?It seemed like a great turnout.  I thought it was a great location for the party.?

?Amaziah has a lot of special needs, and it was very easy to manage him in that environment.  Having a small, contained gym area made it so easy to watch the kids play and talk to families at the same time.?

?The party overall was good, at least for me it felt much less stressful than previous events.?

?I thought the physical space of the venue was pretty good, although there seemed to be no good place to sit and eat. 

?The basketball was a hit with Sam.  Two potential matches for Sam were identified at that party.?

?I actually had great success with the adoption party and had a disclosure yesterday with a potential family that we met there.?

?The event was great!?

?First the turn out was wonderful, so the promotion for this event must have been well done.?

?I thought it went well? I liked the activities at each booth for the children?I always find these events to be helpful for meeting families and networking?. Even if matches aren?t made it?s a good way to talk with/educate potential families.?

?I felt that it was a very good party.  I was so pleased at the number of African American families that were there.  This gives me hope in attending more parties in that region.?

?It was a nice event and the children enjoyed it very much.?

?The children I took had a WONDERFUL TIME.?

?Families showed interest in two of my cases, one was even interested in a sibling group.?

?I thought it went really well. It was well attended and we had positive results.  Three families came forward to take MAPP with us.  Two families were really interested in one of the children we are recruiting for.  One is being home-studied and may actually be a good match. So yes, you guys did a great job? 

?Keep up the good work!?

?I had a family plan to meet Micah at the event and that?s going well, slowly.? 

?I was impressed with the party. The facility, parking, activities, and food were all good.  I think I have made a match, and met some good resources for future reference.?

?I thought it was fantastic! I got a lot of good feedback from the families that cam and they felt that it was well organized and they liked how many different activities there were for the children to participate in.  It felt more relaxed.  I felt that it was well put together and well advertised because there were a lot of people there.?


Suggestions for Improvement:


?The hallways were so crowded.?

?Many families were looking for younger children.?

?Having activities for older kids where there is natural interaction between the families and the kids would perhaps be better than a basketball hall, where all the kids play together and only the ?athletic? dads feel comfortable getting involved.?

?Maybe setting up teams of two and pairing waiting kids with a waiting adult for a competition against other teams, periodically throughout the party, or something like that??

?I don?t like the idea of waiting children being in the same room as prospective families.?

?I would prefer to have the children with the entertainment in one part of the building and the prospective parents and social workers in another.?

?It's personal, I am not comfortable with the whole 'viewing', 'looking' over the children.  I would rather people view the photos if available or read the profiles.  The interactions should take place among the adults in case of children 0-12 and maybe on a case by case we may introduce a pre-teen to a prospective parent if child wants.?

?I always find these events a bit challenging for our older kids.  They are aware when no one is showing interest in them.?

?I think that the physical set up of the event was difficult, our child was uncomfortable with all the pictures of waiting children that he had to pass when he got food. He became quite withdrawn.?

?The Jordan?s event back in the fall was a good example of how the kids are made to feel more comfortable. It really felt like a ?party?.?

?The DJ that was there was very concerning. It felt like he was attempting to sell our kids.?

?One suggestion I could make about the party would be to separate the arts and crafts from the agency presentation area. Some of the kids are really sensitive about being put out there with flyers, etc. and anything we can do to make them more comfortable in an already uncomfortable environment would be beneficial.?

?In the past the event took place on a Sunday. I believe that the turn out was also successful as people came in after church.?

?I brought a 10 year-old boy to the party, so all he did was play basketball the entire time. 
Therefore, I didn't really get a chance to experience anything that was going on out in the hallway.?

?A prospective parent recommended someway of showing what adult is with each child.  He said like matching stickers on nametags or same colored writing. He said it makes it easier than asking the child directly who he is there with.?
?There seemed to be too much openness around the entrances and it seemed like anyone could walk in off the street, I would suggest perhaps setting up the registration tables in such a way that you have to go through them to get in to prevent anyone who is not supposed to be there from being there. We didn't have a problem with anyone but it looked like anyone could come in.?
?A comment that I heard from workers was that there was no way to tell which children were at the event as waiting children, children of the families attending the event or children of people working at the event.?
?It was also difficult to do an activity at the same table where you were talking to families about children who are waiting.  There are some topics that we need to tell families about that are not appropriate to say in front of children either they are not age appropriate or they could cause the children to remember negative events.?
?It would have been nice if there were volunteers who did crafts with the children in another area of the building.?","Y"

SUGGESTIONS from SW


Paige has many issues including mental health diagnoses and Reactive Attachment Disorder.  When we tell families this, we usually don't hear back.  I did talk to a few families about a sibling group that I have but didn't feel that any were really good matches for the boys.   If I had any suggestions, it would probably be to have less snack food!  Between the cookie making table, cookies after lunch and those unbelievable cupcakes on the way out (they looked good?but I followed rules and didn't take one), Paige was on a sugar high and then crashed on the way home (that part was fine with me!)

All I can think of is that there could have been more activities for the older children. All of the arts and crafts seem to be really geared to the younger children and Sam was not at all interested in what was offered. If it's nice outside usually the older children can form a baseball game or something but because it was drizzly we pretty much had to stay inside. Luckily the rain paused enough for Sam to go play basketball - otherwise it would have been a very long 3 hours. I would love to see in the future perhaps a few more arts and crafts geared towards older children.

Unfortunately no matches were found, and the party was catered for younger children so he did not have as much fun as he did at the Jordan's Adoption party.  Will there be an adoption party for older kids 11 and up in the near future (Maria Teixeira).

The most difficult part of the party was waiting in line for the face painting and balloon animals. I know it's costly, but I would suggest having more than one person doing those activities. And of course, if the weather cooperated, there would have been more room for everyone, but obviously that is not under your control.

PRAISE from SW

I thought that the activities were well received by the attending children and that there was a good attendance. 

There was a huge amount of interest generated for Star (Ann Fillippi)

Paige had a good time. As always, I felt the party was well run with plenty of things to do for the kids (Elizabeth Davidson).

I loved the party! I thought you all improvised well with the weather and it worked with all being inside.  The scavenger hunt was good in getting people to mingle. I like this adoption location better than many others because it is conducive to being able to talk with families and letting the kids play in a more natural setting (especially when we can play outdoors).  Thank you for your effort!

The adoption party was great. Justin had a great time. All the activities were great and you guys did a great job.  I went there last year and it was just as great. Too bad it rained though. The activities were great and really kept the kids entertained. (Jennifer Luke)

I was impressed with the party and the only bad thing was the weather that the children couldn't go outside more as they wished to.  Otherwise all went well.

I have received numerous homestudies and need to go through them ASAP (Eulalia Leandreas-Green) 

I thought the party was great.  There are some matching attempts in the works due to the event, but no final matches yet. (Nakeisha Conward)

I did receive a couple of homestudies, which I'm in the process of reviewing. (Stephanie Goldberg). 

After the adoption party, I have received a lot of requests for information about Adamariz and Amaziah. At this point, I have not identified a match for them. (Tami Mainemer).

There were some potentials? for Nichelle and for Tiana. The children all had a good time. Tiana loves to try to do everything. Which she proudly stated that she had on the way home (the only problem was that I accidentally gave her mini-Frisbee to Rayvonne's foster mother)  And Nichelle found something to keep her occupied and ""out of the fray"". (Margot Crawford).

Thanks for the follow-up; I did have two families that were interested 
in Luis and am working on getting in touch with the workers to give and 
receive more information. (Jamie Brodeur).","Y"

Themes in YMCA Adoption Party Follow-Up Survey:

What was most helpful for you about the adoption party? 
-Meeting social workers 
-Meeting kids and seeing them interact with others.
-Meeting other families and hearing stories from those who had already gone through the process
                -Listening to staff and adoptive parents at initial meeting
                -info booklet and all other ways of gathering information
                -Set-up so they could talk to social workers away from kids.

What was least helpful for you about the adoption party?
-Too many parents and social workers, not enough kids 
-Not relaxing enough, awkward to interact with kids. Suggested group activities, funny contests or audience participation type-things
-Set-up was confusing. Some families couldn?t figure out what they were supposed to do. Others could not figure out who was who (colored name tags weren?t helpful for them).
-More profiles/information on children who are available for adoption. Some families said it would be good to have info on kids who would be at party before they got to the party","Y"

Debrief Notes from Jordan's Advisory Board Meeting on 10/9/09:

?	73 waiting children, 191+ staff, volunteers, foster/adoptive families, and 215 waiting families in attendance
?	Of the 215 families, 148 were not homestudied; 67 were homestudied
?	Of the 215 families, 106 had pre-registered; 109 were walk-ins
?	Feedback/ideas for next year
o	Beantown was loud; need to remind social workers and families that they are welcome to use showrooms for quiet conversations and/or if a child needs a break
o	T-shirts for the children worked well; bracelets were fun, but difficult to see
o	Put check-in for volunteers, staff without children in a different place from children/social workers
o	MARE has followed-up with families that requested immediate follow-up; will follow-up with all families over the next couple of weeks
o	PowerPoint for orientation went very well
o	Post Adoption Services did not have many families; maybe put them in Sleep Lab with Regions to float?
o	Coat Racks
o	Move Boston and Metro signage in Sleep Lab forward so that it can be seen when you walk in
o	Talk to social workers more about bringing ?shadows? for the children (foster parent, another worker); give social workers a better sense of the party and which children would be appropriate to bring (Nancy Kinder and DCF SE Regional help the area offices do this)
o	Good idea from Child and Family- social workers who were in the Sleep Lab had photos on their cell phones of the children and their social workers so they could help families locate them","Y"

Families were asked to arrive at 3:00pm for an orientation to the adoption event in the Performing Arts Center.

Contacted Laurie Anastopoulous regarding the children she would be bringing to the event.  Contact Benedicta Gomes, Ida Gordon and Nakeisha Conward from the Boston ADLU for additional families and children for the event.  Followed up with Ron's Ice Cream who will provide the shoes, pizza and ice cream for the attendees in agreeance that we keep the party under 60 persons because the space is limited. NB

06/09/2010~ In addition to receiving confirmation, I'm asking families to send a photo and a small family blurb to create a family booklet for workers in addtion to the waiting child booklet for the families.  Still awaiting responses as I'm working on this. NB

06/14/2010~ Some families who've received flyer from their worker have also RSVP'd for the event (David Chabot and Sebastian Chen).  Also, four other children have been added to the roster for attending the party (two are unregistered). NB

06/14/2010~ Benedicta also sent three additional families to add to the list of families attendig Friday's event.  One family isn't in the MARE system so I'm waiting for Benedicta to give me some information in order to register her for the event. NB

06/15/2010~Sent out an email to Benedicta and Laurie to find out which workers would be attending the event and bringing children so we can get an esitmate of numbers.  Ron's Ice Cream charges $10pp for folks who want to bowl and eat, $12 to include that and ice cream.  Bowling alone is $7.50pp and just to eat is $5.00pp.  So far, including children, workers and MARE staff, we are looking at 40 people total. MARE will be funding the cost of this event.NB

06/16/2010~ Received numerous calls about the party from workers outside the region wondering why we didn't advertise the event on the MARE website.  It has come to my attention that Benedicta sent the flyer to all ADLU supervisors in the state looking for families to attend and requested that folks RSVP herself or myself.  I received a request for a Metro child to attend the event prior and didn't realize how the worker heard about the event.  I'm hoping that folks don''t show up without an RSVP because this will interfere with crowd control since we have such limited spacing at the bowling facility. NB

06/17/2010~ Finalized my lists of Children, Workers and Families.  Numbers are at about 45.  Both Waiting children and families booklets are proofed, printed and folded for the event.  Planning on setting up around 3:30pm and brining my final rosters and signs to help families with approaching children and bowling with them.  Children and families that have no information but RSVP'd to the event are not in the booklet because information is not available or incomplete. NB

6/18/2010 ~ Final Costs: $350 to Ron's Ice Cream on AMEX (21 people at $12/head for bowling/pizza/ice cream, 13 staff at $7.50/head for pizza/ice cream).  Four pans of cheese pizza were served as well as fountain sodas/juices and each person got small ice cream of their choice.   Ron  was present throughout the event and presented short history of the establishment.  Schedule: Bowling, pizza, bowling, ice cream.  The first round of bowling was mostly random matches.  After pizza children were instructed to remain in their lanes and families were re-assigned based on good matches.  BC","Y"

Rebecca Clegg followed up with Jamie Cortes on 12/28/15 to pay $100 deposit using Jennifer Traficanti's MARE AMEX. Also confirmed Jamie Cortes received COI from MARE.

Event is from 10:30-12:30. Last year party was from 11-1 and open to the public at 1. It felt like MARE staff was kicking people out at 1 so we asked to have a half hour of clean up and last minute mingling before the public was able to come in. 

$250 Building Rental
$5 Meal Deals -2 slices of pizza and 16oz soda/drink (MARE is paying for all families, SW, volunteers, waiting children) - Collect tickets at food counter, tally up how many tickets at the end of party before paying remainder of bill. Last year they gave us rolls of tickets and expected us to hand them out in order of number but we split the ticket rolls up so several people working the event would be able to pass out tickets when people were ready to take them. This created confusion at the end when paying for food and Roll On staff almost overcharged us for food because tickets were not in order.
$4.50 skate rentals- MARE is paying for all SW and children. SW and children receive a ticket for skates at registration table. Families pay for their own and will be directed to the Reward Zone at registration.
MARE is renting 5 skate mates TOTAL at $2.50 for kids to share during event. Skate mates will be on the rink and can be used on a first come first serve basis. 

Coming in @ 9:30 to set up. We will use picnic tables for arts & crafts, mingling, board set up, and small tables for registration. *Sent out to families ahead of time - child list, making the most of adoption parties guide, and how to family profile. 

Lisa Darrigo's daughter and her field hockey teammates will volunteer at event. Same girls as previous year. Rebecca Clegg reached out to Lisa to ask and Lisa confirmed 9 girls should be able to attend. Gave Lisa Darrigo the details of the party on 12/29/15.

Cap child and family registrations at about 40

totals:

Notes for next time:
CORI checks for volunteers and write list of names/emails
buy 10 skatemates at discounted rate and utilze volunteers more
get tickets to distribute and give back what wasn't used for total spent (ask for more as needed)
*Send out to families ahead of time - child list, making the most of adoption parties guide, and how to family profile.
improve crowd control - congested registration and SW area
no game machine toys displayed - ask staff not to display unless giving to the kids as prizes

*Sent out to families ahead of time - child list, making the most of adoption parties guide, and how to family profile. 

$300 Building Rental ($50 more than last year)
$5 Meal Deals -2 slices of pizza and 16oz soda/drink (MARE is paying for all families, SW, volunteers, waiting children) - Collect tickets at food counter, tally up how many tickets at the end of party before paying remainder of bill. Last year they gave us rolls of tickets and expected us to hand them out in order of number but we split the ticket rolls up so several people working the event would be able to pass out tickets when people were ready to take them. This created confusion at the end when paying for food and Roll On staff almost overcharged us for food because tickets were not in order.
$4.50 skate rentals- MARE is paying for all SW and children. SW and children receive a ticket for skates at registration table. Families pay for their own and will be directed to the Reward Zone at registration.
MARE is renting 10 skate mates TOTAL at $2.50 for kids to share during event. Skate mates will be on the rink and can be used on a first come first serve basis. 

Cap child and family registrations at about 40-50
