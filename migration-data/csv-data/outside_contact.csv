Wed 07/15/2015 Hi Anna, I'm a public librarian in Massachusetts and I was just updating our MARE Photolisting book when I noticed it's in rough shape. It looks like someone dropped it and knocked the rings out of alignment. Is there any way to replace the binder? We like to keep the book looking bright and new! Thank you, Amanda

Hi Anna,

I work in a public library, and we recently had a request from a patron for the MARE Photolisting?.
We currently do not have this resource at the Townsend Library. What do I need to do to start receiving the MARE Photolisting??

I hope you can help me with this question, if you are not the right person to contact, could you point me in the right direction?

Thank you for any information you can provide.

-Molly
